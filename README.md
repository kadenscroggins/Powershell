# Powershell
A collection of Powershell scripts I've written.

[CompareADGroups-v1.ps1](https://github.com/kadenscroggins/Powershell/blob/main/CompareADGroups-v1.ps1) - Takes two usernames and prints the groups that are present on the first user but absent on the second user. Created to streamline the process of setting up access for new users.
